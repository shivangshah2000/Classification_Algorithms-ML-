Different Classification Algorithms in Machine Learning

1. K_Nearest_Neighbors:- The first project is Breast Cancer detection which uses K-nearest-neighbor algorithm to find whether a person is suffering from benign or malignant cancer.
The features used in the modelling are clump_thickness,unif_cell_size,unif_cell_shape,marg_adhesion,single_epith_cell_size,bare_nuclei,bland_chrom,norm_nucleoli and mitoses.
In K-nearest-neighbor algo the distance is calculated using Euclidean distance which is sqrt((x1-x2)**2+(y1-y2)**2).
